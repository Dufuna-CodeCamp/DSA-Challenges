# Dufuna-CodeCamp Data Structures & Algorithms Challenges 

This repository houses submissions for DSA challenges by the Dufuna-Codecamp participants

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository.

- Before you work on a set of challenges, you should do the following:
    - create a new branch.
    - move to the newly created branch.

- On your local repository, you'll find a `submissions` directory:
	- create a new folder in that directory. This will be your folder.
	- name the folder using the format detailed below:
		- suppose your `first name` is `Jane` and your `last name` is `Doe`, your folder will be named `janeDoe`.

## Making a Submission

- Create and navigate to a new branch

- In your folder, create a folder for the current challenge. E.g. `challenge1-arrays`, `challenge2-string-manipulation`.

- Create different files for the different questions under each challenge directory. E.g. `question1.js`.

- Commit your changes

- Push these changes to the remote repository. If your branch is named `johnDoe_challenge1`, your git command would be `git push origin johnDoe_challenge1`

Go to the remote repository on Github and make a Pull Request.

## Pull Requests

When you create a Pull Request, add a title corresponding to the name of the challenge e.g. `challenge1-arrays` and a description that lists the questions you have solved. e.g. `Question 1, Question 2, Question 3`

## NOTES

Before starting a new challenge, always update your `master` branch locally by pulling using `git pull origin master`
